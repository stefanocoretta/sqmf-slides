## Difference between two groups

We have two hypotheses:

- **Null Hypothesis**: the difference between the means of Group A and B *is 0* (i.e. there is no difference).

- **Alternative Hypothesis**: the difference between the means of Group A and B *is not 0*.

$$H_0: \mu_a - \mu_b = 0$$

## Student's *t*-statistic

---

- We need a standardised measure of difference.

--

- One such measure is the **Student's *t*-statistic**.

$$t = \frac{\mu_b - \mu_a}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2_a}{n_a} + \frac{\sigma^2_b}{n_b}}}$$

where:

- $\mu_a$ and $\mu_b$ are the means of group A and B.

- $\sigma^2_a$ and $\sigma^2_b$ are the squared standard deviations (i.e. variances) of group A and B.

- $n_a$ and $n_b$ are the sample sizes of group A and B.

## Two-tailed *t*-test and *p*-value

- Difference between means: 60 ms.

- *t*-statistic: 2.12.

- *p*-value: 0.0352

--

<br/>

**There is a 0.0352% probability that we would find a difference that is 60 ms or more, assuming that the null hypothesis (`\(H_0: \mu_a-\mu_b = 0\)`) is true.** 

--

<br/>

.f3[If *p* is small enough, we can reject the null hypothesis (that there is no difference).]

--

.f3[But **how small** is small enough?]

---

## The $\alpha$-level

We need to **set a threshold**, i.e. a value of *p* below which we decide to **reject the null hypothesis**.

--

<br/>

This threshold is known as the **α-level** and for most purposes:

.f1[
$$\alpha = 0.05$$
]

--

<br/>

In other words:

- If *p* < 0.05: we reject the null hypothesis.

- If *p* ≥ 0.05: we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

## Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

---

This method of statistical inference is called **Null Hypothesis Significance Testing**, or NHST, or frequentist approach.

--

- The difference between two means is **significant** if the *p*-value is smaller than 0.05 (the α-level).

--

- The difference between two means is **not significant** if the *p*-value is equal to or greater than 0.05 (the α-level).

--

- If the difference between two means is significant, then we can reject the null hypothesis. If it is not significant, we canno reject the null hypothesis.

---

**IMPORTANT**:

- We can **only either reject or not reject the <u>null hypothesis</u>**!

--

- **NHST does not allow us** to make statements about the alternative hypothesis.

  - A significant result (i.e. difference or effect) does not mean that the alternative hypothesis is correct.
  
  - It only indicates that the result is compatible with the alternative hypothesis, but does not provide evidence for it.

--

- **NHST also does not allow us to accept** the null hypothesis, only reject it.

--

- ***p*-values are sensitive to sample size**: they decrease with increasing sample size.

  - In other words, a non-significant *p*-value will become significant with greater a sample size.

--

- NHST is somewhat **perverse**, or at least very **counterintuitive**.

## *p*-values and linear models

---

- `g/lm()` report *p*-values by default.

- `g/lmer()` report *p*-values when the lmerTest package is attached.

---

```{r mald-lm-1, echo=TRUE}
mald_lm_1 <- lm(RT ~ IsWord * PhonLev, data = mald_1_1)

summary(mald_lm_1)
```

---

```{r mald-lm-2, echo=TRUE}
library(lmerTest)
mald_lm_2 <- lmer(RT ~ IsWord * PhonLev + (IsWord | Subject), data = mald_1_1)

tidy(mald_lm_2)
```

---

### Reporting

We fitted a linear model with a Gaussian distribution to reaction times in milliseconds. As predictors we have included whether the word is a real or a nonce word (`IsWord`), phonemic Levinshtein distance (`PhonLev`) and the interaction between the two.
A by-subject varying intercept was also included together with a by-subject varying slope for `IsWord`. Including a varying slope for PhonLev led to non-convergence, so it was dropped.
*P*-values were obtained with the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al. 2017) using the Satterthwaite's approximation of degrees of freedom.

According to the model, the mean reaction time with real words and Levenshtein distance equal 0 is about 661 ms (SE = 34, *t* = 19.356, df = 1269.461, *p* < 0.001).
When the word is a nonce word, reaction times increase by 195 ms (SE = 47, *t* = 4.182, df = 3024.393, *p* < 0.001).
The effect of Levenshtein distance is an increase of about 42 ms in reaction time for every unit increase (SE = 4.4, *t* = 9.464, df = 4933.716, *p* < 0.001).
The interaction between IsWord and PhonLev indicates an effect decrease of 12 ms, although it is not significant (`\(\beta\)` = -12, SE = 6.3, *t* = -1.926, df = 4934.293, *p* = 0.0542).

```{r mald-lm-3, echo=TRUE}

### Reporting

We fitted a linear model with a Bernoulli distribution (aka binomial or logistic regression) to accuracy. As predictors we have included whether the word is a real or a nonce word (`IsWord`), phonemic Levinshtein distance (`PhonLev`) and the interaction between the two.
A by-subject varying intercept was also included together with a by-subject varying slope for `IsWord`. Including a varying slope for PhonLev led to non-convergence, so it was dropped.
*P*-values were obtained with the lmerTest package (Kuznetsova et al. 2017) using the Satterthwaite's approximation of degrees of freedom.

According to the model, the mean accuracy with real words and Levenshtein distance equal 0 is about 84% (`\(\beta\)` = 1.67, SE = 0.386, *z* = 4.321, *p* < 0.001).
When the word is a nonce word (and Levenshtein distance is 0), accuracy decreases to 57% (`\(\beta\)` = -2.83, SE = 0.63, *z* = -4.493, *p* < 0.001).
The effect of Levenshtein distance on accuracy in real words correponds to an increase of 0.077 log-odds although it is not significant (SE = 0.053, *z* = 1.451, *p* = 0.147).
The interaction between IsWord and PhonLev indicates there is an effect increase of 0.4 log-odds with nonce words (SE = 0.088, *z* = 4.572, *p* < 0.001).
