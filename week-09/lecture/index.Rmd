## Difference between two groups

We have two hypotheses:

- **Null Hypothesis**: the difference between the means of Group A and B *is 0* (i.e. there is no difference).

- **Alternative Hypothesis**: the difference between the means of Group A and B *is not 0*.

$$H_0: \mu_a - \mu_b = 0$$

$$H_1: \mu_a - \mu_b \neq 0$$

## Student's *t*-statistic

---

- We need a standardised measure of difference.

--

- One such measure is the **Student's *t*-statistic**.

$$t = \frac{\mu_b - \mu_a}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2_a}{n_a} + \frac{\sigma^2_b}{n_b}}}$$

where:

- $\mu_a$ and $\mu_b$ are the means of group A and B.

- $\sigma^2_a$ and $\sigma^2_b$ are the squared standard deviations (i.e. variances) of group A and B.

- $n_a$ and $n_b$ are the sample sizes of group A and B.

## Two-tailed *t*-test and *p*-value

- Difference between means: 60 ms.

- *t*-statistic: 2.12.

- *p*-value: 0.0352

--

<br/>

**There is a 0.0352% probability that we would find a difference that is 60 ms or more, assuming that the null hypothesis (`\(H_0: \mu_a-\mu_b = 0\)`) is true.** 

--

<br/>

.f3[If *p* is small enough, we can reject the null hypothesis (that there is no difference).]

--

.f3[But **how small** is small enough?]

---

## The $\alpha$-level

We need to **set a threshold**, i.e. a value of *p* below which we decide to **reject the null hypothesis**.

--

<br/>

This threshold is known as the **α-level** and for most purposes:

.f1[
$$\alpha = 0.05$$
]

--

<br/>

In other words:

- If *p* < 0.05: we reject the null hypothesis.

- If *p* ≥ 0.05: we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

## Null Hypothesis Significance Testing

---

This method of statistical inference is called **Null Hypothesis Significance Testing**, or NHST, or frequentist approach.

--

- The difference between two means is **significant** if the *p*-value is smaller than 0.05 (the α-level).

--

- The difference between two means is **not significant** if the *p*-value is equal to or greater than 0.05 (the α-level).

--

- If the difference between two means is significant, then we can reject the null hypothesis. If it is not significant, we canno reject the null hypothesis.

---

**IMPORTANT**:

- We can **only either reject or not reject the <u>null hypothesis</u>**!

--

- **NHST does not allow us** to make statements about the alternative hypothesis.

  - A significant result (i.e. difference or effect) does not mean that the alternative hypothesis is correct.
  
  - It only indicates that the result is compatible with the alternative hypothesis, but does not provide evidence for it.

--

- **NHST also does not allow us to accept** the null hypothesis, only reject it.

--

- ***p*-values are sensitive to sample size**: they decrease with increasing sample size.

  - In other words, a non-significant *p*-value will become significant with greater a sample size.

--

- NHST is somewhat **perverse**, or at least very **counterintuitive**.
